My solutions for Advent of Code 2022. Requires nightly Rust.
My challenge to myself with this was to make solutions that are idiomatic Rust, run at least reasonably fast, and only use the standard library.

To run Day 2's solution, for example:
```
cargo run -- 2
```
And so on for the other days. If the day number is omitted, it will run the latest day solved.
